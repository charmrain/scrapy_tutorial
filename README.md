the progress that I am learning scrapy framework


### some git tricks (off topics of scrapy)

#### add the URL for the remote repository
git remote add origin <Remote_URL>

#### delete local branch
git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>

#### delete remote branch
git push origin --delete <BRANCH_NAME>
* this has to make sure that the delete branch is not default one

#### solve the error of "refusing to merge unrelated histories"
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
